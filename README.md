## Mission

This is a project to deepen my knowledge of C-programming, the Linux kernel,
and the HTTP standard. One day I will host my personal website with this.

## Requirements

This server is made to run on PopOS 22.04. It should be fine on any
Debian-based OS.

## Build Instructions

Build with your favorite compiler. I use GCC.
